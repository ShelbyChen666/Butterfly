                        of the flower. Its wings, a deep velvety black,
                        are adorned with small, vibrant orange dots that shimmer in the sunlight. The butterfly's
                        delicate body, poised on the petal,
                        seems almost weightless as it gracefully flits from flower to flower. The contrasting colors of
